# api/helpers/

This is the directory that holds your helpers. Helpers are shared functions that can be called from anywhere in your app.

When you call `markhor generate helper tickle-user` via the command line from inside your project's root directory, Cli will generate the file `api/helpers/tickle-user.js`, with a skeleton helper file to get you started.
