# api/policies/

This is the folder you will store your &ldquo;policy&rdquo; files in.  A policy file is a JavaScript file that contains what is essentially Express/Fastify middleware for authenticating access to controller actions in your app.

For example, if you want to make sure only authenticated admin users can access `http://yourapp.com/admin/dashboard`, this is the folder you would put that logic in.
