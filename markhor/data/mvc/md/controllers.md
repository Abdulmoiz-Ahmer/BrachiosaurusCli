# api/controllers/

This is the directory that holds your controllers. Controllers are JavaScript files that contain logic for interacting with models and returning appropriate responses to the client.

When you call `markhor generate api cats` via the command line from inside your project's root directory, Cli will generate the file `api/controllers/CatsController.js` along with a matching model.

The `api/controllers` directory can also contain _standalone actions_, which are JavaScript files containing a _single_ controller action, rather than a dictionary of actions.
